    'Questions 1 and 2':"Question 1: A priori, it is very dificult to hipothesize about the main drivers that students take into acount when deciding a career, also, we have to make sure that the client can influence those variables, for example, if we determine that the students go on a specific career path due to their parents paths, that information wouldn't be usefull at all since the client cannot do anything about it. So taking that out of the picture, lets start with the 'in the box' thinking, price, marketing, trade and distribution are the usual old boring variables that permeate businesses, so the classic CPG study on those variables is fundamental. For example, maybe just decreasing the price, or adjusting the price student is more usefull that one might think at first glance. There are infinite ways of changing prices, for example, a scholarship system is just a consumer discrimination price strategy. Regarding marketing, focusing on the university rankings is crucial for the consumer choice. \n Now come the 'out of the box' hipothesis, brainstorming requires more people, but maybe an idea would be to open new careers. Now that we recognize all the possible levers, the information must be scraped in order to correctly actionize on them.  ",
